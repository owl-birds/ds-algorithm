# BIG O

is a way to categorize ur algorithms time or memory requirements based on input.

-> it is not meant to be an exact measurement. it will not tell you gow many cpu cycles ut takes, instead it is meant to generalize the growth of ur algorithm.

for example O(n) --> o of n ---> the growth of ur algorithm is linear

--> GROWTH wis with respect to the INPUT

--> we focus on worst cases

# CONCEPTS TAKEN

- growth is with respect to the input
- constant are dropped
- worst case is usuallt the way we measure

--> BIG O : Upper Bound
