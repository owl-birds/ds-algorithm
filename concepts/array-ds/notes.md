# ARRAY

[val] [val] [val] [val] [val]

0 ----> n

[ ... ]

simple contigous memory space

array not grown ->>

so when u insert something u overwrite it

a + width(in bit) \* offset

## conlusions

- arrays are fixed size, continiguous memory chunks
  - that means you cant grow it
  - there is no "insertAt" or push or pop. doesnt mean u cant write those though
